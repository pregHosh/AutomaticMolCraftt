# Analysis Tools

The **Analysis tools** tab enriches the loaded dataset by running computations as asynchronous background jobs. Each job either adds new columns to the dataset or replaces existing XYZ geometries with optimized versions.


!!! note
    A compiled dataset must be present (loaded via the [Data Manager](data-manager.md)) before running any tool.

*The Analysis tools workspace: pick a tool and source under Settings, configure its parameters, then queue and run the step.*

!!! tip "Your own scripts as analysis tools"
    Any script that reads a folder of XYZ files and writes a CSV can be added to this tab as an
    [external command plugin](plugin-tools.md#external-command-plugins) — no changes to the script or the app.
    The shipped example `plugins/nhc_buried_volume/` computes NHC buried volume, octants and quadrants.

## General workflow

The tab is organized around a step queue:

1. **`1` Settings** — pick the **Analysis tool** and the **Analysis source** (which dataset/staged source to run on).
2. **`2` Parameters** — configure the tool's parameters, then click **Add to queue**. Repeat to chain several steps (e.g. XYZ to SMILES → validity → xTB).
3. Each queued step has a **Post action**: **No post-action**, **Apply results** (merge new columns into the dataset when the step completes), or **Register optimized set** (add the result as a staged source in the Data Manager — used for geometry optimization outputs).
4. In the **Workflow** panel, click **Run**. Steps execute one at a time as background jobs; you can navigate to other tabs while waiting. **Pause**, **Cancel active**, and **Clear workflow** control the run; a paused or failed workflow shows **Resume** instead of Run.
5. Completed jobs appear in the **Analysis queue** panel with a status badge (`queued / running / completed / failed / cancelled`) and a log/terminal button to inspect the raw output. If a step ran without a post action, you can still click **Apply results** (or **Apply all results**) or **Register optimized set** there afterwards.

**Cancelling**: click **Cancel** on a queued or running job. **Clear queue** removes finished jobs from the list.

## Recommended run order

Many tools depend on outputs from earlier ones:

1. **XYZ to SMILES** — produces the `smiles` column required by validity checks and similarity filters.
2. **Validity and connectivity metrics** — use SMILES + XYZ to flag bad geometries; filter these out before expensive calculations.
3. **XTB geometry optimization** *(optional)* — replace raw geometries with optimized ones before running single-point calculations.
4. **XTB electronic properties** — single-point calculations on the (optionally optimized) geometries.
5. **Featurize** — compute SOAP or UMA vectors.
6. **Dimensionality reduction** — project featurization vectors to 2D for visualization.
7. **Predict properties** — run a MolCraftDiffusion checkpoint for property inference.

## Tool reference

### Validity and connectivity metrics

Checks each molecule's geometry and connectivity against a set of chemical rules and flags problems as boolean columns.

**Metric sets** define which rules are applied:

| Metric set | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `core` | Basic valence rules, bond lengths, formal charges |
| `posebuster` | Core checks + pose-level geometry (torsions, clashes, planarity) |
| `geom_revised` | Revised geometry thresholds from the geom_revised benchmark |

| Parameter | Default | Options | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Metric set | `posebuster` | core, posebuster, geom_revised | Rule set to apply |
| Recheck topology with RDKit | false | boolean | Re-evaluate bond connectivity using RDKit after the initial parse. Useful if `xyz2mol` assigns bonds incorrectly |
| Molecule converter | `xyz2mol` | xyz2mol, openbabel | Algorithm used to infer bonds from XYZ coordinates. Switch to `openbabel` if `xyz2mol` fails for your element types |

**Output**: one boolean column per validity criterion (True = passes the check). Failed molecules are `False`.

---

### XYZ to SMILES conversion

Converts each molecule's XYZ geometry to a **SMILES** string (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System — a compact linear notation for molecular connectivity, e.g. `CCO` = ethanol). Also computes two derived representations:

**Morgan fingerprint** — a fixed-length binary vector encoding each atom's local chemical environment up to a given bond radius. Used as a numerical molecular representation for similarity search and machine learning.

**Bemis–Murcko scaffold** — the core ring-and-linker framework of a molecule stripped of all side chains. Used to group molecules by structural class.

| Parameter | Default | Range | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Morgan fingerprint bits | 2048 | integer | Length of the fingerprint vector. 1024–4096 are typical values; longer vectors are more discriminating but use more memory |

**Output columns added**: `smiles`, `morgan_fp` (vector), `scaffold` (SMILES string of the ring system).

Run this tool first — the `smiles` column enables SMARTS and similarity filters in the Visualization tab.

### XTB electronic properties

Runs **xTB** (extended tight-binding) single-point quantum-chemical calculations. xTB is a fast semi-empirical method that gives approximate but chemically meaningful electronic descriptors in seconds per molecule.

**xTB methods available:**

| Method | Speed | Accuracy | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| GFN1-xTB | Fastest | Lower | Large datasets, initial screening |
| GFN2-xTB | Moderate | Higher | General-purpose; recommended default |
| PTB | Fastest | Moderate | Very large systems where GFN2 is too slow |

| Parameter | Default | Options | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| XTB method | GFN2-xTB | GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, PTB | Level of theory |
| Charge | 0 | integer | Net formal charge of all molecules in the dataset. If molecules have different charges, pre-split the dataset |
| Unpaired electrons | 0 | integer | Number of unpaired electrons (0 = closed-shell, the typical case for drug-like molecules) |
| Solvent | *(empty)* | string | Implicit solvent name (e.g. `water`, `acetonitrile`, `methanol`). Leave empty for gas-phase calculation |
| Property group | `energy` | see below | Which property set to compute |
| Timeout per molecule | 120 s | integer | Maximum wall time before marking a molecule as failed. Increase for large or complex structures |
| Parallel jobs | 1 | integer | Number of molecules calculated simultaneously. Set to the number of CPU cores available |
| Apply empirical correction | true | boolean | Apply Grimme's empirical correction to ionisation potential and electron affinity values |

**Property groups:**

| Group | Columns added |
|---|---|
| `energy` | Total energy (Hartree), HOMO energy, LUMO energy, HOMO–LUMO gap |
| `dipole` | Dipole moment magnitude (Debye) |
| `reactivity` | Ionisation potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), chemical potential (μ), hardness (η), softness (S), electrophilicity (ω) |
| `global` | Combined energy + reactivity descriptors |
| `charges` | Per-atom partial charges (added as a vector column) |
| `fukui` | Fukui electrophilic (f⁻) and nucleophilic (f⁺) indices (per-atom vector columns) |
| `bond_orders` | Mayer bond orders for all atom pairs (vector column) |
| `all` | All of the above |

Start with `energy` for a quick screen; add `reactivity` if you need IP/EA/hardness; use `all` for a comprehensive descriptor set before featurization.

### XTB geometry optimization

Relaxes each molecule's geometry to a local energy minimum. The output either replaces the original XYZ coordinates in-place or is registered as a new staged source.

**MMFF94** (Merck Molecular Force Field 94): a classical force field optimized for drug-like organic molecules. Faster than xTB but less accurate for heteroatoms, strained systems, or unusual bonding.

| Parameter | Default | Options | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Optimization level | `gfn2` | gfn1, gfn2, gfn-ff, mmff94 | Method for geometry relaxation. GFN2 is the recommended default; use mmff94 for very large molecules or if xTB is too slow |
| Charge | 0 | integer | Net formal charge |
| Timeout per molecule | 240 s | integer | Maximum wall time. Optimization is slower than single-point; increase for large structures |
| Covalent radii scale factor | 1.3 | float | Scale applied to covalent radii when assigning bonds from XYZ coordinates. Increase (e.g. to 1.5) if bonds between distant atoms are being missed |

After the job completes, choose:
- **Apply results** — overwrites the current XYZ geometries for those molecule IDs in-place.
- **Register optimized set** — adds the optimized geometries as a staged source in the Data Manager. Behavior depends on the **ID prefix** and **Data source label** fields:

| ID prefix | Data source label | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Empty | Same as the original data source | Replacement mode — original source rows are removed; optimized rows take their place |
| Non-empty | Different from the original data source | Append mode — optimized rows are added as a new staged source with the prefix prepended to their IDs; the label must not already exist |

---

### Featurize

Computes a fixed-length numeric vector for each molecule, used as input for dimensionality reduction or external ML models.

**SOAP (Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions)**: encodes each atom's local chemical environment as a rotationally invariant power spectrum, then pools per-atom descriptors into one vector per molecule. Purely geometry-based — no SMILES needed.

**UMA**: a neural network–based featurizer that produces dense molecular embeddings.

**Morgan fingerprint**: computes a Morgan (circular) fingerprint directly from a SMILES column via RDKit — runs in-process, no XYZ or GPU required. Needs an existing SMILES column (e.g. from XYZ to SMILES conversion).

| Parameter | Default | Applies to | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Backend | `soap` | all | Choose SOAP (geometry-based), UMA (neural), or Morgan fingerprint (SMILES-based) |
| Auto-detect species | true | SOAP | Automatically infer the element list from the dataset. Disable to specify elements manually for reproducible vectors across datasets with different compositions |
| r_cut | 6.0 Å | SOAP | Cutoff radius for the local atomic environment. Larger values capture longer-range interactions but increase vector length |
| n_max | 8 | SOAP | Number of radial basis functions. Higher = finer radial resolution |
| l_max | 6 | SOAP | Maximum angular momentum (spherical harmonic order). Higher = finer angular resolution. Computational cost scales as (l_max + 1)² |
| sigma | 0.1 | SOAP | Gaussian smearing width for atomic densities. Larger sigma smooths out geometry noise |
| Pooling | `mean` | SOAP, UMA | How per-atom descriptors are combined into one vector: `mean` (average) or `sum` (total) |
| UMA model path | *(empty)* | UMA | Optional path to a local UMA checkpoint. Relative paths resolve from the repository root; leave empty for the default checkpoint |
| UMA device | `cpu` | UMA | `auto` selects GPU if available; `cpu` forces CPU; `cuda` forces GPU |
| UMA batch size | 8 | UMA | Number of molecules processed per GPU batch |
| SMILES column | *(required)* | Fingerprint | Dataset column holding SMILES strings to fingerprint |
| Morgan radius | 2 | Fingerprint | Circular fingerprint radius (bond hops considered around each atom) |
| Morgan bits | 2048 | Fingerprint | Length of the fingerprint vector |
| Use chirality | false | Fingerprint | Encode stereochemistry in the fingerprint |
| Use feature invariants | false | Fingerprint | Use pharmacophoric feature invariants instead of plain atom types |

**Output**: a vector column added to the dataset. This column is the required input for Dimensionality reduction.

### Dimensionality reduction

Projects a high-dimensional molecular vector column to two numeric coordinates (e.g. `dim_red_x`, `dim_red_y`) that can be used as scatter plot axes in the Visualization tab.

**UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**: preserves both local neighbourhood structure and global topology. Faster than t-SNE for large datasets. Distances in the 2D plot are more interpretable.

**t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: prioritises local cluster structure. Better at revealing tight clusters, but global distances are not meaningful and results vary with random seed.

| Parameter | Default | Applies to | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vector column | *(required)* | both | The featurization column to project |
| Algorithm | UMAP | both | UMAP or t-SNE |
| Metric | `euclidean` | both | Distance metric: `euclidean`, `cosine`, or `manhattan`. Use `cosine` for high-dimensional sparse vectors (e.g. Morgan fingerprints) |
| Random seed | 42 | both | Fix for reproducibility |

**UMAP-specific:**

| Parameter | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Neighbors | 15 | Number of nearest neighbours in the high-dimensional space. Smaller = finer local structure; larger = more global view |
| Min distance | 0.1 | Minimum distance between points in 2D. Smaller = tighter clusters |
| Epochs | 0 (auto) | Optimisation iterations; 0 lets UMAP choose based on dataset size |
| Learning rate | 1.0 | Step size for the embedding optimiser |
| Spread | 1.0 | Overall scale of the 2D embedding |
| Low memory | true | Use a slower but memory-efficient graph construction algorithm; keep enabled for datasets > 10 000 molecules |

**t-SNE-specific:**

| Parameter | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Device | CPU | `CPU (openTSNE)` or `CUDA (tsne-cuda)` — GPU can be 10–100× faster for large datasets |
| CUDA device | 0 | GPU index when device = CUDA |
| Perplexity | 30 | Effective number of neighbours; typical range 5–50. Increase for large, dense datasets |
| Learning rate | 200 | Gradient step size. If the embedding collapses to a ball, increase this value |
| Iterations | 1 000 | Total optimisation steps. Increase for large datasets |
| Early exaggeration | 12.0 | Amplification of inter-cluster distances in the early optimisation phase — helps clusters separate |
| Theta | 0.5 | Barnes–Hut approximation (0 = exact but slow; 1 = fastest but less accurate) |
| Initialization | PCA | Starting layout for the embedding: `PCA` (recommended, deterministic), `Random`, or `Spectral` |
| Parallel jobs | 1 | CPU threads for openTSNE |

**Output**: two numeric columns added to the dataset, e.g. `dim_red_x` and `dim_red_y`. Bind these to the X/Y axes of a scatter plot in the Visualization tab to see the chemical space layout.

### Predict properties

Runs property inference using a MolCraftDiffusion checkpoint. Only models that expose property predictors (CFG-trained models) appear in the list.

| Parameter | Options | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Predictive model | select from available checkpoints | The checkpoint used for inference |

**Output**: one numeric column per predicted property, added to the dataset.

This is useful for predicting properties on a new set of molecules (e.g. generated structures) using a model trained on labelled data.
